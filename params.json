Having to decide on a specific framework or library up-front, and spreading that implementation-specific code throughout the code base is simply too risky. Why not just start with the simplest possible abstraction and decide on the implementation later and in a single place, the bootstrapping/app start?\r\n\r\n### Where\r\nYou can get Tracer at:\r\n\r\n- [Main interfaces](http://kzu.to/PEgjcT)\r\n- [log4net adapter](http://kzu.to/PEgl4A)\r\n- [NLog adapter](http://kzu.to/PEgncC)\r\n- [Enterprise Library Logging 5.0 adapter](http://kzu.to/PEgoxc)\r\n- [System.Diagnostics adapter](http://kzu.to/PEiP2S)\r\n\r\nFork it on [GitHub](http://kzu.to/PEiUne).\r\n\r\n\r\n### How\r\nAs elaborated in the [introductory blog post](http://kzu.to/PEgB3o \"Tracer: the unified, dead-simple API for all logging frameworks in existence\"), it's not worth it to introduce a binary dependency for something that is really extremely simple (just 3 types). So you install via [nuget](http://nuget.org/) the main interfaces in your \"Common\" or \"Core\" project which is shared by the components that will do the logging, by using:\r\n\r\n\tinstall-package tracer\r\n \r\nand then use the following code to retrieve a tracer and log to it:\r\n\r\n\tpublic class MyComponent\r\n\t{\r\n\t\tprivate static readonly ITracer tracer = Tracer.Get<MyComponent>();\r\n\t \r\n\t\tpublic void DoSomething()\r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\ttracer.Info(\"Doing something...\");\r\n\t\t\t...\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n\r\nYour bootstrapper or application startup code will take a dependency on a concrete adapter implementation mentioned in the Where section, and initialize the Tracer with the following line:\r\n\r\n\tTracer.Initialize(new TracerManager());\r\n\r\nAnd that would be all!","google":"UA-3240245-5","note":"Don't delete this file!
